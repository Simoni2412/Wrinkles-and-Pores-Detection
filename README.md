Hereâ€™s an updated data flow integrating the possible improvements:

# Enhanced Data Flow Diagram for Wrinkle Detection:

# 1. Image Input & Preprocessing:
    Acquire facial image
    Resize, normalize, and apply histogram equalization (CLAHE) for improved contrast
    Perform data augmentation (brightness adjustment, rotation, flipping) to enhance dataset variability

# 2. Facial Landmark Detection & Masking:
    Detect facial landmarks using Mediapipe or Dlib
    Apply masking to extract specific facial regions (T-zone, U-zone, B-zone)

# 3. Segmentation & Dataset Generation:
    Manually or semi-automatically label wrinkles in images
    Create a segmented dataset for training the model

# 4. Feature Extraction & Model Processing
    Pass masked images through Reduced U-Net with Attention module
    Integrate Gaussian filtering for noise reduction
    
# 5. Wrinkle Scoring Algorithm
    Define wrinkle intensity metrics (contrast, depth, density)
    Compute wrinkle score using statistical and deep learning approaches
    Experiment with transformer-based attention mechanisms for better feature localization

# 6. Age Estimation Based on Wrinkle Score
    Establish correlation between wrinkle severity and age
    Use a multimodal age prediction approach (combining wrinkles with skin texture and elasticity)
    Improve model robustness with ensemble learning

# 7. Output Display
    Display detected wrinkles and highlight key facial regions
    Show estimated age along with confidence level
